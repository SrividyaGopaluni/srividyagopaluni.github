				<h1>Vijaya Surya Srividya Gopaluni</h1>
				<p> I am Srividya Gopaluni, I am from India. I am pursuing my Masters in Information systems. I have completed my bachelor's degree in India from Vignan Institute of Technology and Science in Computer Science Engineering. After graduation, I have worked with Infosys Limited as a Software Engineer for 3 years.
                     I have worked with the BMW client, where I was responsible for the configuration, administration, and maintenance of the Policy Servers and WebAgents on Client Servers. These responsibilities made me a good team player, leader and also a good communicator. With the job experience for three years, I learned that practical work & experience is more important than just theoretical learning, as our profession involves the extensive application of the theory.
                     For Hobbies, I love gardening, cooking, singing. My interest in singing during my school days led me to get trained in Carnatic music(Indian Classical Music). I keep telling myself "If I cannot fly, Just let me sing and feel it".</p>
